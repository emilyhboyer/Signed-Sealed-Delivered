The Signed, Sealed, and Delivered Project was created by Emily Helen Boyer, a current World History PhD student at Northeastern University, as part of the NU Digital Certificate program.
This project seeks to use TEI encoding to better transcribe probate records of the 17th and 18th centuries, as these records are often marred by illegible handwriting, damage (due to age), or errors in the scanning process. 
SSD begins in Charles County, Maryland, as this county was one of the largest during the 17th and 18th centuries, which in-turn means that there is a large pool of probate records to transcribe and encode. 
It is SSD goal to transcribe every probate record from Charles County and St. Mary's County by the end of 2026, and in the future hopes that all of colonial Maryland will be transcribed. 

There are two goals that have driven the creation of this project. First, this project was created to have a complete record of probate transcriptions for the state of (colonial) Maryland. While users on websites such as Ancestry and independent genealogists have transcribed numerous probate records, there is a lack of  consistency in the encoding and organization of these records.

The second goal or driving force behind the creation of Signed, Sealed, and Delivered is to create a system that allows for researchers to keep track of the land and wealth accumulated during the 17th and 18th centuries. Probate records offer an important insight into the wealth accumulation experienced in colonial America. By having a dedicated space in which probate records are transcribed and encoded, it therefore becomes easier to extract information pertaining to the number of acres owned by individuals in a given county, trends in tobacco production, and makes the tracking of dowries and women's wealth accumulation more manageable. 

This project is intended as an independent research project which will be used for further research on Boyer's part, such as in her PhD dissertation, as she is interested in looking at early wealth accumulation in the United States and better understanding the United State's economic development, especially along the Mid-Atlantic. At this time the Signed, Sealed, and Delivered Project is not open for public collaboration. Visitors to the site are, however, more than welcome to use the completed (encoded) probates and the information that they contain for their own research projects and self-interest. 

In addition to probate records, it is the goal of SSD to further transcribe corresponding inventory records as to show the cost of the items bequeathed to individuals in the probate records. The future timeline of this project is as follows:
1. Complete Maryland, Register of Wills Records, Wills 1665-1708 by October 1st, 2026.
2. Begin encoding Maryland, Register of Wills Records, Wills 1704-1733 vol 3 starting October 5th, 2026.

This project was named because the phrase "Signed, Sealed, and Delivered" (sometimes "Published" rather than "Delivered") is used at the end of a probate record to denote the both the end of the main body of a probate, but also to signify the beginning of the probate that includes the witnesses names. This is often  accompanied by a witness statement, where the witnesses mentioned are said to have sworn to have seen the author (main subject) of the probate either create the will and agree to its contents, or state that they can confirm that the author is now deceased.
