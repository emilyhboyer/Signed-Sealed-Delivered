The Signed, Sealed, and Delivered Project was created by Emily Helen Boyer, a current World History PhD student at Northeastern University, as part of the NU Digital Certificate program.
This project seeks to use TEI encoding to better transcribe probate records of the 17th and 18th centuries, as these records are often mared by illegible handwriting, damage (due to age), or errors in the scanning process. 
SSD begins in Charles County, Maryland, as this county was one of the largest during the 17th and 18th centuries, which in-turn means that there is a large pool of probate records to transcribe and encode. 
It is SSD goal to transcribe every probate record from Charles County and St. Mary's County by the end of 2026, and in the future hopes that all of colonial Maryland will be transcribed. 
In addition to probate records, it is the goal of SSD to further transcribe corresponding inventory records as to show the cost of the items bequeathed to individuals in the probate records.
