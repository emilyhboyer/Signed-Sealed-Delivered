The Signed, Sealed, and Delivered Project was created by Emily Helen Boyer, a current World History PhD student at Northeastern University, as part of the NU Digital Certificate program.
This project seeks to use TEI encoding to better transcribe probate records of the 17th and 18th centuries, as these records are often mared by illegible handwriting, damage (due to age), or errors in the scanning process. 
SSD begins in Charles County, Maryland, as this county was one of the largest during the 17th and 18th centuries, which in-turn means that there is a large pool of probate records to transcribe and encode. 
It is SSD goal to transcribe every probate record from Charles County and St. Mary's County by the end of 2026, and in the future hopes that all of colonial Maryland will be transcribed. 

The ultimate goal of this project is to have a complete record of probate transcriptions for the state of (colonial) Maryland. While users on websites such as Ancestry and independent geneologists have transcribed numerous probate records, there is a lack of consistancy in the encoding and organization of these records. This project is intended as an independent research project which will likely be used for further research on Boyer's part. If others are interested in contributing to this project or would like to discuss Boyer's methods, please navigate to Contact under the Wiki page. 

In addition to probate records, it is the goal of SSD to further transcribe corresponding inventory records as to show the cost of the items bequeathed to individuals in the probate records. The future timeline of this project is as follows:
1. Complete Maryland, Register of Wills Records, Wills 1665-1708 by October 1st, 2025.
2. Begin encoding Maryland, Register of Wills Records, Wills 1704-1733 vol 3 starting October 5th, 2025.

This project was named because the phrase "Signed, Sealed, and Delivered" (sometimes "Published" rather than "Delieverd") is used at the end of a probate record to denote the both the end of the main body of a probate, but also to signify the beginning of the probate that includes the witnesses names. This is often accomanied by a witness statement, where the witnesses mentioned are said to have sworn to have seeing the author (main subject) of the probate either create the will and agree to its contents, or state that they can confirm that the author is now deceased.
